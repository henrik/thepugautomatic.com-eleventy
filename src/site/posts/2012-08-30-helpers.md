In Rails, all helpers are included in all views by default.

So your `UsersHelper` methods are also available to your `ItemsController` views.

I don't like having that much stuff in the same namespace. Method names may collide, or else need inelegant prefixes.

This setting makes things more sensible:

``` ruby config/application.rb
config.action_controller.include_all_helpers = false
```

`ApplicationHelper` is still included in all views. `Admin::UsersHelper` is only included in `Admin::UsersController` views. If that controller inherits from `Admin::BaseController`, then `Admin::BaseHelper` will be included as well.

And here's a nice (and fairly obvious) trick: you can still use regular Ruby modules to organize your methods into more than one file.

For example, I like to have a `LayoutHelper` that the application layout template can use:

``` ruby app/helpers/layout_helper.rb
module LayoutHelper
  def some_layout_helper_method
    "Flappity flippity."
  end
end
```

``` ruby app/helpers/application_helper.rb
module ApplicationHelper
  include LayoutHelper

  def some_global_helper_method
    "Hippity wippity."
  end
end
```

With `include_all_helpers` off, the `LayoutHelper` isn't automatically included anywhere. But by simply `include`ing it in the global `ApplicationHelper`, now its methods are global too.

You get the benefits of splitting helpers into multiple files, without the downsides of having every helper available everywhere.
