<a href="http://www.deviantart.com">deviantART</a> redesigned, pleasing eyes and breaking userscripts.

It will likely be a while until I've deprecated or rewritten (as appropriate) all my scripts, since I rarely use the site myself.

I did, though, update my <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1873">thumbnail as favicon</a> script, and wrote <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5088">another, tiny script</a> to in effect change the default from zoomed out to zoomed in images.
