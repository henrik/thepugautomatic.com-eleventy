I have no idea how well-known this is, but (all?) digital cameras/webcams display infrared light.

I used this when my MacBook remote stopped working (battery ran out), to confirm it did not output anything and that the problem was not on the receiving end.

One can also take pictures in the visible dark, illuminated by a remote control diode.
