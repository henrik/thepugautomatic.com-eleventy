I love that OS X is so very scriptable and customizable. For example, if you don't like the appearance of some application, resources like its text strings and images are usually right inside the application package (simply a folder with special treatment) to be edited like any other text or image.

Reshacking was never less impressive.

I'm still trying to get used to the metadataness of the iLife suit. I miss Winamp, but I'm trying to learn how to do the things i want in iTunes. It turned out that the iTunes Party Shuffle function is somewhat like Winamp's queuing system. However, the name makes me gag. So I renamed it.

This is simply a matter of replacing occurrences of "Party Shuffle" with something decent (I went with "Mixlist"), in the file <code>/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/ Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings</code>. Then reopen iTunes.

This assumes you're using the English locale for iTunes/OS X.

Apply it with e.g.

``` bash
patch /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/ Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings < partyshufflebegone.diff
```
