I made the installation process a whole lot easier, made retrieving schedules and re-generating the iCal feed wholly automatic, and squashed some bugs. There is also a pretty icon.

Now distributed as an .app (run it for installation/configuration; also contains the scripts) within a .dmg within a .zip &ndash; <a href="https://henrik.nyh.se/filer/iCalTV.zip">get it here</a> (266 kB).

The included README file is <a href="https://henrik.nyh.se/filer/README.html">available here</a> (44 kB due to an inline image).

<p class="updated"><a href="https://henrik.nyh.se/2006/09/icaltv-05-released/">iCalTV 0.5 has been released &ndash; the above post is outdated.</a></p>
