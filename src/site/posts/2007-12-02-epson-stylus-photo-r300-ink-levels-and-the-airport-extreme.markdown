So <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=airport%20epson%20%22ink%20levels%22">Epson printer software doesn't display ink levels unless the printer is connected directly to a computer</a>. I ran into this just now when connecting my girlfriend's R300 to our Airport Extreme.

Just wanted the Google to know that this doesn't seem to be a big deal after all, since
<ul>
<li>a red indicator light will flash on the printer when ink is running low; and</li>
<li>you can show ink levels on the printer display â€“ just arrow below the last item in the "Advanced" menu, onto a second screenful, and there it is.</li>
</ul>
