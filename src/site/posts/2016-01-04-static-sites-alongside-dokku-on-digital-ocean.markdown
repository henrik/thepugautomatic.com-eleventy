I host most of my dynamic sites with [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a94740416de7) (referral link), through [their one-click install](https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/dokku/?refcode=a94740416de7).

Dokku is basically a self-hosted [Heroku](https://www.docker.com/), letting you run all your Sinatra, Rails, Phoenix or what-have-you apps [containerized](https://www.docker.com/) with little hassle.

I also have some static sites, though, like this blog.

You [can get static sites on Dokku](https://www.florianheinemann.com/github/dokku/2014/11/17/Hosting-static-pages-on-Dokku.html), but it feels a bit bloated to me, adding some magic files and then building a container, when you could just deploy by copying the files. A simple static site takes some 15 seconds to deploy via Dokku, vs. 1 second via `rsync` or `scp`.

So instead, I hosted them alongside Dokku, using the same Nginx that fronts Dokku.

## Find a place on the server

If you set up Dokku with Digital Ocean's one-click installer, you will have a `dokku` user home directory (`/home/dokku`) and a `root` user home directory (`/root`).

Neither seemed appropriate to store the static sites. Dokku makes assumptions about files stored in the `dokku` home directory. And Nginx (the `www-data` user it runs as) can't access stuff under `/root`. Nevermind any security implications of using the root account for this.

So, I created a new user named `static`:

    adduser static

Enter some password (and store it away) when prompted. Just accept the defaults for the other fields.

Then, I put the static files somewhere under that user's home directory, like `/home/static/sites/my-site.com`.


## Configure Nginx

Dokku adds some stuff to Nginx â€“ we can too, without conflict.

Thanks to [a suggestion by Mikkel Malmberg](https://twitter.com/mikker/status/684106604107706369), we can set up a single piece of Nginx configuration that should cover most static sites.

Create an `/etc/nginx/conf.d/static_sites.conf` file (incidentally, right next to Dokku's `dokku.conf`):

``` nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d/static_sites.conf linenos:false
server {
  server_name ~^(?<domain>.+)$;
  root /home/static/sites/$domain;

  access_log /var/log/nginx/$domain-static-access.log;

  # error_log can't contain variables, so we'll have to share: http://serverfault.com/a/644898
  error_log /var/log/nginx/static-error.log;
}
```

If you like, you can verify that there are no errors in the configuration:

    sudo nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Then restart Nginx so it picks up this addition:

    sudo service nginx restart

This configuration uses [regular expression server names](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html) to automatically map any hostname to `/home/static/sites/<hostname>`. So in the spirit of Dokku, adding new sites requires a minimum of setup. Just point the DNS to the server, add the static files to a directory named like the hostname, and you're done.

If you need custom Nginx configuration for one site, just add a file to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` with that configuration, and restart Nginx like above. Nginx [is smart enough](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html#optimization) to prefer exact hostname matches when they exist, and fall back otherwise.
