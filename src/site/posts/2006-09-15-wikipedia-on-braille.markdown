Everything about Braille is interesting! Excerpt from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille">Wikipedia</a>:

<blockquote><p>In English, the system of Grade 2 Braille contractions begins with a set of 23 words which are contracted to single characters. Thus the word <em>but</em> is contracted to the single letter <em>b</em>, <em>can</em> to <em>c</em>, <em>do</em> to <em>d</em>, and so on. Even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases; for example, <em>d</em> is, specifically, an abbreviation of the verb <em>do</em>; the noun <em>do</em> representing the note of the musical scale is a different word, and must be spelled out.</p>

<p>Portions of words may be contracted, and many rules govern this process. For example, the character with dots 2-3-5 (the letter "f" lowered in the braille cell) stands for "ff" when used in the middle of a word. At the beginning of a word, this same character stands for the word "to" although the character is written in braille with no space following it. At the end of a word, the same character represents an exclamation point.</p></blockquote>
