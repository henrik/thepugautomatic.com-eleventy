Say you have this file open in Vim:

{% filename "example.js" %}
``` javascript example.js
one();

console.log("about to do two");
two();
console.log("did two");

three();

console.log("about to do four");
four();
console.log("did four");
```

The logging helped you figure out an issue and now you want to be rid of the `console.log` lines.

There's (not surprisingly) a quick way to do that in Vim:

```
:g/log/d
```

Any line matching the Vim regular expression `/log/` will be removed.

More generally, `:g[lobal]` runs the given Ex command on the matching lines. In this case, the command is `:d[elete]`.

For more details, see `:help :g`.

I've only used this to remove lines, but it has [all sorts of applications](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Power_of_g).
