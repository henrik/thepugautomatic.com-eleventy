[Our team](http://barsoom.se) was inspired by [Thoughtbot's Code Review guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review) to start making changes to [our styleguide](https://github.com/barsoom/devbook/tree/master/styleguide) through pull requests rather than discussions during the retro.

Since we already make styleguide decisions by consensus, I thought it would be silly, fun and possibly useful to translate [the Crisp consensus model](http://blog.crisp.se/2014/03/27/peterantman/crisp-consensus-model-2-1)…

…into GitHub emoji:

👍 Yes please! I actively support this.

👉 Let's discuss further. We don't have all the facts yet.

👎 Veto! I feel that I have all the facts needed to say no.

👊 I stand aside. I neither support nor oppose this.

There's no thumb-to-the-side emoji, and the pointing hand isn't a great substitute. [Any ideas?](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)

I don't know yet how this will turn out, or [if we'll do it at all](https://github.com/barsoom/devbook/pull/2), but I do like the idea.
