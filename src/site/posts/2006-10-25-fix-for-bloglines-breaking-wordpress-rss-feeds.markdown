If you're reading this through a feed reader, you might have seen a lot of recent posts marked as new. This would be because I just changed the WordPress generation code slightly to compensate for a <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> issue.

The issue is that the part of a blog post after a cut will be all blue, because Bloglines will replace the cut anchor (something like <code>&lt;a id="more-123"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>) with some broken code of its own, including links that span the cut contents.

<!--more-->

Ideally, Bloglines would solve this themselves. I reported the problem months ago. Since they haven't, though, I solved it for my own blog by simply making the cut anchor into a <code>div</code> tag rather than an <code>a</code> tag. The anchor still works, and Bloglines no longer messes with my feed.

I'm running WordPress 2.0. I've no idea if the problem or this solution apply to other versions. I did notice <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> feeds get the same treatment, thoughâ€¦

The file to change is <code>wp-includes/template-functions-post.php</code>, around row 90. Unidiff (<a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/uploads/bloglineswordpress.diff">download</a>):
