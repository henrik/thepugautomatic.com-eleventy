Just a quick post for Google:

To get <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">Sass</a> working with <a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb 1.0.1</a>, I had to add this to <code>init.rb</code>:

``` ruby
require 'sass'
```

Merb has been changing rapidly up to 1.0: when I googled this, I saw other solutions where you added the <code>'haml'</code> dependency or didn't have to do anything. Neither of those worked for me with Merb 1.0.1, though.
