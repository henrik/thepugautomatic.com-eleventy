The last few days, there has been some buzz in the macosphere about Panic's <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>. Coda basically bunches editing, web viewing, file transfer, SSH and more together in a single app, where you can open up a "site favorite" to restore all those to where you left off.

I gave it a (very short) try and found that it looks very nice, but I prefer using more powerful dedicated apps.

The idea of a macro to open up the right files in your text editor, the right session in your FTP client and so on is nice, though, so I made an AppleScript for this. I'm not sure I'll use it a lot, but once I realized it should be called "Coda Light" (("Coda" is a trademark of Panic, Inc.)), I couldn't resist.

<a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/uploads/Coda%20Light.app">Download</a> the script.

Open it in <code>Script Editor.app</code> and edit the configuration values, then just run it (by e.g. double-clicking) at your pleasure.

The script will
<ul>
 <li>open the project in <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>,</li>
 <li>open related URLs in the default browser,</li>
 <li>open the related favorite in <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> (FTP) and</li>
 <li>open a related SSH session in Terminal.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The code</h4>

``` applescript
-- Coda Light
-- By Henrik Nyh <http://henrik.nyh.se>, 2007-04-26
--
-- An AppleScript to start working on a web development project by
--  * opening the project in TextMate,
--  * opening related URLs in the default browser,
--  * opening the related favorite in Transmit (FTP) and
--  * opening a related SSH session in Terminal.
--
-- Inspired by Coda <http://www.panic.com/coda/>. Coda is a trademark of Panic, Inc.

----------------------------
-- Configure here
----------------------------

-- Full path to local file, TM project or folder
set localProject to "/tmp"

-- These will be opened in the default browser
-- (Set to {} to open nothing)
set URLs to {"http://localhost/~me/somesite", "http://example.com/somesite"}

-- The name of a related Transmit favorite
-- (Set to "" if you don't want to open Transmit)
set transmitFavorite to "Some site"

-- SSH server
-- (Set to "" if you don't want a SSH session)
set sshServer to "example.com"
-- SSH username (set to "" to use defaults)
set sshUser to ""
-- The SSH password must be entered manually; optionally set up DSA keys so you don't have to input it at all: see e.g. http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20011128174701140
