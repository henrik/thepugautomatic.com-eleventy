Not at all a new find, but I love this:

<blockquote><p><em>Referer</em> is a common misspelling of the word <em>referrer</em>. It is so common, in fact, that it made it into the official specification of HTTP – the communication protocol of the World Wide Web – and has therefore become the standard industry spelling when discussing HTTP referers.</p></blockquote>
