Tagging in iPhoto is an annoying matter of dragging photos to fields or checking boxes.

There is a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kenferry/software.html">Keyword Assistant</a> that does not run in Intel mode, and a <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/25785">Keyword Tool</a> that didn't do it for me inbetween the crashes.

I wrote my own AppleScript (with some nested Ruby for string manipulation) that suits me better.

<p class="updated"><span class="when">2006-09-12:</span> <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kenferry/software.html">Keyword Assistant</a> now works with Intel.</p>

I hooked it to <code>&#x21E7;&#x2303;T</code> using <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>. Just select the images to tag or untag and run the script.

A dialog prompts for the keywords. Start with a minus to untag. Separate keywords with commas.

Keywords you use must exist within iPhoto already. The script tries matching what you type to extant keywords in two ways, in descending order of preference. Matching is case-insensitive.

The first method is a prefix match. "foo" is e.g. resolved to "Foobar".

The second method is an initials match. "fb" is e.g. resolved to "Foo Bar" unless there is e.g. a "Fbsomething" (prefix match).

If several keywords match using the same method (e.g. two keywords share a prefix) the alphabetically first one is used.

So If the iPhoto keywords available are "Henrik, Johan, Johanna, Linnea, Linnea K", I could type "h,j,lk" to tag with "Henrik,Johan,Linnea K". To tag with "Johanna" I'd need to type at least "Johann". To untag all, I could type "-h,j,lk".

The script doesn't handle non-ASCII well, because text encoding was too much pain in this case, and because I don't need it myself.

-- Does not handle non-ASCII very well.
