I keep discovering neat things you can do in Vim.

Every Vim user knows you can save the current buffer with `:w`.

But you can also pass a filename: `:w ~/my.backup`. Then the contents of the current buffer are written to that file. It happens in the background, so to speak – the filename of the current buffer doesn't change, unlike `:saveas`.

If you make a visual selection first, only those lines are written to the specified file.

I've used this for two things:

To copy and paste between two Vim sessions. I do `:w /tmp/x` in one Vim, and `:r /tmp/x` (or `:read /tmp/x`) in the other.

And just now, I realized I could use it to break one file into two. I had some secret authentication info alongside some experimental code. I wanted to start version controlling that code, so I needed to extract the secrets. I visually selected those lines, did `:w ~/.secret.rb` and then replaced the lines with `require "~/.secret.rb"`. Reminds me of the useful [`:Rextract` in Rails.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails#readme), but built in.

Something else I discovered in `:help :w`, but haven't put to use yet, is `:w >> /some/file` to append.
