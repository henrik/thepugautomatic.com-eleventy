This is something I've noticed but haven't seen mentioned elsewhere. It applies to recent Macs with multi-touch gestures (MacBook Air and new MacBook Pro).

In QuickTime Player as well as in Quick Look of a video or picture, you can use the "pinch open" gesture to enter full screen mode. "Pinch close" will exit full screen.

Quite handy.
