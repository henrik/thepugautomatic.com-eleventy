By <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-terminal-here-and-glob-select-in-leopard-finder#comment-57404">request</a>, I did an "Open In TextMate" Finder toolbar icon for Leopard.

I also took the opportunity to write a new script, based on <a href="http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/1037">Simon Dorfman's</a>. Clicking the toolbar icon now opens the selected file or files if there is a selection; otherwise it opens the current directory. You can also drag-and-drop files to the icon to open those.

Behind the scenes, the script is all AppleScript, without dropping into the shell. Feels a bit more robust.

A single TextMate window will open, containing all selected or dropped items in a project.

I put my icon inside the bundle, so it should appear with no extra effort. I also toggled a flag in the bundle so you don't see the script appear and disappear in the dock when triggered.

Download <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/uploads/OpenInTextMate.zip">OpenInTextMate.zip</a>, extract the file somewhere (I keep it in <code>/Applications/Scripts</code>), then drag it onto the Finder toolbar. You'll need to wiggle it a bit for the toolbar to catch on.

If you like your toolbar all grayscale, feel free to use <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/uploads/openintextmate-droplet.icns"><img src="http://henrik.nyh.se/uploads/openintextmate-droplet.png" alt="[tm]" /></a> (save the linked icon file, <em>not</em> the displayed PNG image)  instead, and copy it into the script as <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-terminal-here-and-glob-select-in-leopard-finder">described here</a>.

The code:

``` applescript
-- Opens the currently selected Finder files, or else the current Finder window, in TextMate. Also handles dropped files and folders.
